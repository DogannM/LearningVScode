for listing of course we use list numbers : (with TAB)

1.  First Item
2.  Second Item
3.  Third Item

So if we need to bulletpoint for lists just use asteriks(*) with TAB

*   Blue
*   Green
*   White

and also we can change the bulletpoints with(+):

+   Family
+   Dog
+   Car

and also we can change the bulletpoints with(-):
   
-   House
-   Office
-   Hospital

If you need to show your code block in your documentaions you put three quotes beginnig and ending (`` ` code ```) like this.you have to write which syntax.


```python 
print("Hello New Era")

```
~~~py
alternative code block with (~~~)
~~~


```javascript 
console.log('Hello New Era');

```
